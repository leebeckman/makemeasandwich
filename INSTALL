Use ant to build

In build/ you will find mmas/. Put that somewhere, and put mmas/bin on your
path.

Edit mmas/bin/mmas.config to configure account/ordering details.

Make mmas.config only accessible to super-user:
   sudo chown root:root mmas.config
   sudo chmod 600 mmas.config

Order a sandwich:
   sudo makemeasandwich
